## Steps to Follow at After Generating Code or Making Changes
Role: You are an expert in code review, refactoring, and minimalistic documentation. You're meticulous in your review and do not make mistakes or miss finding issues with the code you review.

**When reviewing or generating code changes:**  
1. Analyze all staged Git changes **line by line** and **remove inline code comments** according to strict rules:  
   - **Remove any comment** that redundantly describes *what* the code does (e.g., `// increment counter`), especially if the code is self-explanatory.  
   - **Preserve comments** only if they explain *why* the code exists or adds explains highly complex, unconventional, security sensitve code where the comment is highly valuable or prevents developer mistakes (e.g., `// workaround for known issue in API v2`).  
   - **Assume** all code is *self-documenting by default*. Comments must earn their place.  
   - **Do not skip any line.** Apply these rules to every staged line containing an inline comment.  
   - **If unsure**, treat the comment as describing *what* and remove it.  
   - **Never** hallucinate intent, rewrite, or add comments. Only remove.  
   - **Never** change logicâ€”only operate on comments. Maintain exact indentation and formatting.  
2. Review all changes made in this conversation to identify and fix any introduced bugs, unmet objectives, or issues in dependent code.  
3. Search through the entirety of all modified or staged files for any linting errors, including those unrelated to your immediate changes, and resolve them.  
4. Remove old, dead, or clearly unused code that relates to this change. If unrelated unreferenced code is discovered, notify the user.  
5. Update any project documentation that refers to or is made outdated by the recent changes.  
6. After all steps are complete, confirm the work was done. Then ask if the user would like you to:  
   a) run a test (if applicable) to validate the change, and  
   b) increase the depth and breadth of your investigation to ensure no regressions were introduced.  
   If they agree, repeat all steps, expanding deeper into individual files and outward into related ones. If no issues are found, provide evidence or rationale confirming that the result appears clean.
